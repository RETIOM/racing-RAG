state they open the SDC.

side of the relay coil is directly incorporated into the SDC and the other side is controlled by
the hybrid control system.
CV 5 H YBRID SYSTEM
CV5.1 Hybrid System General
CV5.1.1 Hybrid System – the hybrid storage container, motors and every part that is electrically
connected to them.
CV5.1.2 The hybrid system must be a LVS, T11.1 and T11.7 are applied for all hybrid system
components.
CV5.1.3 All electrical parts of the hybrid system except for ground terminals must be covered at least
according to IPxxB when energized.
CV5.1.4 Hybrid Storage Container (HSC) – the electric energy storage system, including the AIR and
overcurrent protection, that is used in the hybrid system.
CV5.1.5 Moving energy into the Hybrid Storage Container (HSC) from a different electric storage
system is prohibited during any dynamic event.
CV5.1.6 A firewall, see T4.8, must be present between the HSC and the fuel tank.
CV5 Hybrid System
CV5.1.7 The HSC must be positioned according to T11.7.2, all other hybrid system components must
be positioned within the surface envelope, see T1.1.18.
CV5.1.8 The high current path, see EV1.2.2, of the hybrid system must meet EV4.5.15.

CV5.2.1 The HSC must be attached to the primary structure, see T1.1.12, according to T9.3.1.
CV5.2.2 A disconnection mechanism, designed as an AIR must be integrated inside of the HSC,
disconnecting the positive pole of the HSC. The AIR must be compliant with EV5.6.3.
CV5.2.3 The maximum total weight of all elements in the hybrid system that store the electric energy,
e.g. battery cells or supercapacitors, including all casings and tabs that are integral to them,
is 3 kg.
CV5.2.4 Holes, both internal and external, in the HSC, are only allowed for the wiring harness,
ventilation, cooling, or fasteners. The total cutout area must be below 25 % of the area of the
respective single wall.
CV5.2.5 The HSC must be removable to be inspected at the mechanical inspection and it must be
possible to easily check the weight limit.

EV1.1 Tractive System
EV1.1.1 Tractive System (TS) – every part that is electrically connected to the motors and TS
accumulators. The LVS may be supplied by the TS if a galvanic isolation between both

EV1.1.2 TS enclosures – every housing or enclosure that contains parts of the TS.
EV1.2 Electrical
EV1.2.1 Galvanic Isolation – two electric circuits are defined as galvanically isolated if all of the
following conditions are true:
-The resistance between both circuits is ≥500Ω/V, related to the maximum TS voltage
of the vehicle, at a test voltage of maximum TS voltage or 250 V , whichever is higher.
-The isolation test voltage RMS, AC for 1 min , between both circuits is higher than
three times the maximum TS voltage or 750 V, whichever is higher.
-The working voltage of the isolation barrier, if specified in the datasheet, is higher than
the maximum TS voltage.
Capacitors that bridge galvanic isolation must be class-Y capacitors.
